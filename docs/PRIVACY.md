# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: February 17, 2026

Prompt Tuner ("we," "our," or "the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data and why our "privacy-first" approach ensures your information never leaves your device.

## 1. Core Privacy Principle
Prompt optimization is executed **locally** via Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model. **No user data (including your prompts, chat history, or personal information) is collected, stored, or transmitted to external servers.**

## 2. Data Handling Practices
- **Processing**: All LLM prompts are optimized on your local device. The extension does not have "phone home" capabilities for your data.
- **Collection**: We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII), such as names, email addresses, or physical locations.
- **Tracking**: We do not use cookies, analytics, or persistent identifiers to track your behavior.
- **Network Activity**: The extension's network activity is strictly limited to fetching static, non-executable optimization rules from GitHub.
- **Sale or Sharing**: We do not sell, trade, or share any user data with third parties, as no data is ever collected.

## 3. Permissions
- **Host Permissions**: Limited to supported LLM platforms (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to allow for UI injection and prompt optimization.
- **Storage**: Used solely to cache optimization rules locally for faster performance and offline support.
- **ActiveTab**: Used to detect the current platform to apply the correct optimization strategy.

## 4. Security
We prioritize the security of the local environment:
- The extension uses a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP).
- UI elements are isolated via Shadow DOM to prevent interference with host pages.
- Local processing ensures that sensitive data in your prompts remains within your browser's secure context.

## 5. Compliance
- **GDPR/CCPA**: As no personal data is collected or processed on servers, the Extension is inherently compliant with major data protection regulations.
- **Children's Privacy**: The Extension does not collect information from children under the age of 13 (COPPA).

## 6. Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. The "Last Updated" date at the top will be revised accordingly.

# Coding Standards & Style Guide

## General Principles
* **Professionalism:** Documentation and comments should be objective. Avoid slang.
* **Intent over Implementation:** Comments should explain *why* a decision was made, not *what* the code is doing (unless complex).

## Language Guidelines

### [Language Name]
* **Naming:** [e.g., camelCase for vars, PascalCase for classes]
* **Type Safety:** [e.g., Strict typing required]
* **Async/Await:** [e.g., Prefer async/await over promises]

## Git Workflow
* **Branches:** Feature branches should be named `feature/description`.
* **Commits:** Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
